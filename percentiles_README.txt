Define a variable male that contains the male heights.
Define a variable female that contains the female heights.
Report the length of each variable.


Suppose we can't make a plot and want to compare the distributions side by side. 
Number of data points is large. So, listing all the numbers is inpractical. 
Create two five row vectors showing the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentiles for the heights of each sex.


Then create a data frame called df with these two vectors as columns. 
The column names should be female and male and should appear in that order.
