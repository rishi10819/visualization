Get data from the survey collected by the United States National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
The NHANES data has many missing values. 

Filter the NHANES dataset so that only 20-29 year old females are included and assign this new data frame to the object tab.

Save the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure as average and standard_deviation to a variable called ref.

Now generate only the average blood pressure for 20-29 year old females and assign it variable called ref_avg.

Save the minimum and maximum of systolic blood pressure as min and max to a variable called ref_min_max.

Compute the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure for females for each age group separately. 

Compute the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure for males for each age group separately. 

Compute the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure for females and males for each age group separately. 

Compute the average and standard deviation for each value of Race1 for males in the age decade 40-49.
Order the resulting table from lowest to highest average systolic blood pressure.
